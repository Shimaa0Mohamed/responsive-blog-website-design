              <p><h2><blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewing"> Sewing </h2>
                is the craft of fastening or attaching objects using
              stitches made with a needle and thread. Sewing is one of the oldest
               of the textile arts, arising in the Paleolithic era. <b><h3>Before the 
               invention of spinning yarn or weaving fabric</b> </h3>, archaeologists believe 
               Stone Age people across Europe and Asia sewed fur and skin clothing
                using bone, antler or ivory needles and <u>thread"</u>" made of various animal
                 body parts including sinew, catgut, and veins.

            For <i>thousands of years</i>, all sewing was done by hand. The invention 
          of the sewing machine in the 19th century and the rise of computerization
         in the 20th century led to mass production and export of sewn objects, but
         hand sewing is still practiced around the world.<b>[2]</b> Fine hand sewing is a 
          characteristic of high-quality tailoring, haute couture fashion, and custom 
           dressmaking, and is pursued by both textile artists and hobbyists as a means of creative expression.[citation needed]

          The first known use of the word "sewing" was in the 14th century.</blockquote></p>
