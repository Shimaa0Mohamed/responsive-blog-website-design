               <p><h2><blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing">Drawing</h2> is a form of visual art in which a person uses various drawing
                 instruments to mark paper or another two-dimensional medium. Instruments include graphite
                  pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, 
                colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, various kinds of erasers,
                 markers, styluses, and various metals<u>(such as silverpoint).</u>  Digital drawing is
                  the act of using a computer to draw. Common methods of digital drawing include a
                   stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad, or in
                    some cases, a mouse. There are many digital art programs and devices.

                A <i><b>drawing instrument</b> </i> releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark
                . The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, 
                leather, canvas, and board, may be used. Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard or indeed 
                almost anything. The medium has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history.
                 It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating visual ideas.[1] The wide availability of drawing
                  instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities.
                
                <b><h3>In addition to</b> </h3>its more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial illustration, animation, architecture,
                 engineering and technical drawing. A quick, freehand drawing, usually not intended as a finished work, is sometimes
                  called a sketch. An artist who practices or works in technical drawing may be called a drafter, draftsman or a 
                  draughtsman.</blockquote></p>
